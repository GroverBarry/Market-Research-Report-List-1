<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastic Rolling Bearings</li><li>Plastic Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Plastic bearings come in two main types: plastic rolling bearings and plastic sliding bearings. Plastic rolling bearings utilize rolling elements, such as balls or rollers, between the inner and outer races to reduce friction. They provide smooth rotation and are commonly used in applications where high speeds and low loads are involved. On the other hand, plastic sliding bearings work by sliding one surface against another, providing a low-friction surface for linear motion. They are often used in applications requiring linear movement or where heavy loads are present.</p></p>
