<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Whiplash Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backrests</li><li>Head Restraints</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Whiplash Protection Systems (WPS) play a crucial role in minimizing the risk of whiplash injuries during rear-end collisions. WPS mainly consist of backrests and head restraints. Backrests are designed to prevent excessive rearward movement of the occupant's torso, reducing the impact on the neck. Head restraints provide support to the occupant's head and neck, limiting their movement during a collision. Both types of WPS aim to minimize the extent of hyperextension and hyperflexion of the neck, thus ensuring better safety for vehicle occupants.</p></p>
