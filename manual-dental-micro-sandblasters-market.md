<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Dental Micro-sandblasters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-tank</li><li>1-tank</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manual dental micro-sandblasters are specialized tools used in dentistry for cleaning and roughening tooth surfaces prior to certain dental treatments. These micro-sandblasters come in different market types, including 2-tank and 1-tank systems. </p><p>In a 2-tank system, the sandblaster consists of two separate tanks; one tank contains abrasive material, such as aluminum oxide particles, while the other tank stores a mixture of air and water. These tanks are connected to a nozzle, allowing the dentist to control the flow of abrasive particles along with water and air, providing better precision during the cleaning process.</p><p>On the other hand, a 1-tank system integrates the abrasive material, air, and water into a single tank. This simplifies the setup and operation of the sandblaster, but can sometimes restrict fine-tuning of the abrasive particle flow.</p><p>Apart from the 2-tank and 1-tank systems, there are other market variations available, which may include additional features or specific designs to cater to different dental practices' needs.</p></p>
