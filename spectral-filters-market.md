<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spectral Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dichroic Filters</li><li>Neutral Density (ND) Filters</li><li>Band-pass Filters</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spectral filters are optical devices used to selectively transmit or block specific wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are designed to reflect or transmit light at certain wavelengths, allowing for efficient separation of different colors. Neutral density filters evenly reduce the intensity of all wavelengths of light, commonly used to control exposure levels in photography. Band-pass filters transmit only a specific range of wavelengths, ideal for isolating a specific color or wavelength. Other types of spectral filters include long-pass filters (transmit longer wavelengths), short-pass filters (transmit shorter wavelengths), and notch filters (block specific wavelengths).</p></p>
