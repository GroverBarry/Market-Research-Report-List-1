<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emergency external defibrillators are medical devices used to restore normal heart rhythm in individuals experiencing cardiac arrest. There are two main types in the market: semi-automated and fully automated defibrillators. </p><p>Semi-automated defibrillators require a healthcare professional to administer an electric shock by pressing a button after analyzing the patient's heart rhythm. This type provides the professional with more control over the process.</p><p>Fully automated defibrillators, on the other hand, do not require the healthcare professional to press a button as they automatically analyze the heart rhythm and administer the shock if needed. This type is designed for ease of use by non-professional bystanders in emergency situations.</p></p>
