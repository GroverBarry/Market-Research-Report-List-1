<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Anthrax Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cell Free PA Vaccines</li><li>Live Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Veterinary Anthrax Vaccines are divided into two types: Cell Free PA Vaccines and Live Vaccines. Cell Free PA Vaccines are created by purifying a specific protective antigen (PA) from the anthrax bacteria, and are considered safer since they do not contain live bacteria. On the other hand, Live Vaccines contain a weakened or inactivated form of the anthrax bacteria, stimulating an immune response in animals. Both types aim to protect animals from anthrax, a highly contagious and often fatal disease, but they differ in their composition and mode of action.</p></p>
