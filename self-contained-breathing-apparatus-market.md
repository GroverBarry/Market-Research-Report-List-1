<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-contained Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) Market Types - Open-Circuit SCBA and Closed-Circuit SCBA</p><p>The Open-Circuit SCBA consists of a face mask connected to an air cylinder that supplies breathable air to the user. When the user exhales, the air is released into the atmosphere, rendering it unusable. This type is commonly used by firefighters and in industrial applications.</p><p>The Closed-Circuit SCBA utilizes a rebreather system that recycles exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and replenishing it with oxygen. This allows for longer usage time and is predominantly used in military and specialized rescue operations.</p></p>
