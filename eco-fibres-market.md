<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eco Fibres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Fibres</li><li>Synthetic Fibres</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Eco fibres market consists of two main types: natural fibres and synthetic fibres. Natural fibres are derived from plants (such as cotton, hemp, and bamboo) or animals (such as wool and silk). They are considered eco-friendly as they are biodegradable and renewable. Synthetic fibres, on the other hand, are man-made from chemicals and petroleum byproducts (such as polyester and nylon). While synthetic fibres offer durability and versatility, their production process usually involves non-renewable resources and contributes to pollution. Both types play significant roles in various industries, but natural fibres are generally considered more sustainable.</p></p>
