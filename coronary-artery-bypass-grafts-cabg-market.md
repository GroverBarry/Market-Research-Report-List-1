<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saphenous Vein Grafts</li><li>Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) procedures are performed to treat blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. There are three main types of grafts used in CABG: Saphenous Vein Grafts, Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts, and other grafts. Saphenous Vein Grafts involve using a vein taken from the patient's leg to bypass the blocked artery. Internal Thoracic Artery Grafts use the patient's internal mammary artery to bypass the obstructed artery. Other grafts can include the use of radial arteries or synthetic materials to create new pathways for blood flow. These grafts aid in restoring blood flow to the heart and improving cardiovascular function.</p></p>
