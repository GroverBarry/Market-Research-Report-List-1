<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Castings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die Casting</li><li>Permanent Mold Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum castings refer to the process of creating solid metal objects by pouring melted aluminum into a mold and allowing it to cool and solidify. There are two main types of aluminum casting: die casting and permanent mold casting. Die casting involves injecting molten aluminum into a steel mold under high pressure, producing complex shapes with high accuracy. Permanent mold casting, on the other hand, uses a reusable steel mold and gravity to fill the mold with molten aluminum, resulting in simpler shapes and lower production costs.</p></p>
