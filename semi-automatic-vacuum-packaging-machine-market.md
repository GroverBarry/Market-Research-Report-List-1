<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Automatic Vacuum Packaging Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>V-FFS</li><li>H-FFS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The semi-automatic vacuum packaging machine market consists of two main types: V-FFS (vertical form-fill-seal) and H-FFS (horizontal form-fill-seal). In V-FFS machines, the packaging material is formed into a vertical tube, filled with the product, sealed, and then cut into individual packages. H-FFS machines, on the other hand, use a horizontal process where the packaging material is formed, filled, sealed, and then cut into separate packages. Both types cater to different packaging needs, with V-FFS machines being more suitable for smaller products and H-FFS machines for larger or irregularly shaped items.</p></p>
