<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving field focused on treating genetic disorders by introducing, modifying, or silencing genes within a patient's cells. The gene therapy market can be classified into two types: viral gene therapy and non-viral gene therapy. Viral gene therapy utilizes viruses as vectors to deliver therapeutic genes into host cells, while non-viral gene therapy relies on various non-viral methods like gene editing tools, plasmids, and nanoparticles for gene delivery. Both approaches aim to correct, replace, or regulate genes to treat diseases, offering promising potential for personalized and targeted therapies.</p></p>
