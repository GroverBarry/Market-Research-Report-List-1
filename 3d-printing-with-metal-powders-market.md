<p><strong>The 3D Printing with Metal Powders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DMLS</li><li>SLM</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>3D Printing with Metal Powders is a growing market that uses two different types of printing technologies â€“ DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) and SLM (Selective Laser Melting). DMLS involves using a laser to melt metal powders, layer by layer, to create complex 3D objects. It is mainly used for creating high-quality prototypes and small production runs. SLM, on the other hand, fully melts the metal powders, resulting in even stronger and denser parts. This technology is commonly used in industries like aerospace and automotive for fabrication of final production components.</p></p>
