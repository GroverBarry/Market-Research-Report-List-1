<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Pads, Shoes, and Linings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Pads</li><li>Brake Shoes</li><li>Brake Linings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive brake pads, shoes, and linings market comprises three main types of braking components: brake pads, brake shoes, and brake linings. Brake pads are made of friction materials and are directly attached to the brake caliper for stopping the vehicle when the brake pedal is pressed. Brake shoes are used in drum brakes and push against the drum to slow down the vehicle. Brake linings, similar to brake pads, create friction against the brake drum or rotor to stop the vehicle's motion.</p></p>
