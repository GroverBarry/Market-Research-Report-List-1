<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Roll Stabilization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Actuator</li><li>Linear Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive active roll stabilization market is divided into two types: rotary actuator and linear actuator. A rotary actuator is a device that converts rotational motion into a linear motion, which is useful in stabilizing a vehicle's roll by adjusting the suspension system accordingly. On the other hand, a linear actuator directly produces linear motion, aiding in roll stabilization by providing adjustable support to the vehicle. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining stability and control during cornering or rough driving conditions.</p></p>
