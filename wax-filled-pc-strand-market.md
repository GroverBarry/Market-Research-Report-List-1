<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wax Filled PC Strand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanized Wire PC Strand</li><li>Uncoated Wire PC Strand</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wax filled PC strand market includes two main types: galvanized wire PC strand and uncoated wire PC strand. Galvanized wire PC strand refers to the process of coating the steel wire with a layer of zinc to protect it from corrosion, enhancing its durability and lifespan. On the other hand, uncoated wire PC strand does not undergo this process, resulting in a lower cost but potentially shorter lifespan. These two market types cater to different customer preferences and project requirements in terms of corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
