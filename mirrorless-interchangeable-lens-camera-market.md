<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>One of the key players in the competitive mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera market is Sony Corp. Sony is a Japanese multinational conglomerate that has a strong presence in the technology and electronics industry. The company's history in the camera industry dates back to its acquisition of Konica Minolta's camera business in 2006. Sony entered the mirrorless camera market with its popular Alpha series, which quickly gained recognition for its advanced technology and high-quality image sensors. Over the years, Sony has consistently introduced innovative features and improved its camera lineup, positioning itself as a strong competitor in the market.</p><p>Sony's mirrorless cameras have experienced significant growth in recent years. According to a report by Technavio, the global mirrorless camera market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4% between 2021 and 2025, and Sony is anticipated to be one of the leading contributors to this growth. The company's strong market position is primarily attributed to its advanced technology, superior image quality, and a wide range of lenses and accessories that cater to the needs of professional photographers.</p><p>Another notable player in the market is Panasonic Corp., a Japanese multinational electronics corporation. Panasonic has a long history in the camera industry and has been manufacturing mirrorless cameras since 2008. The company's Lumix series has gained popularity for its high-quality video recording capabilities and innovative features such as 4K photo and post-focus. Panasonic's mirrorless cameras have a strong presence in both the consumer and professional markets, offering a versatile range of models for different user needs.</p><p>According to Statista, Panasonic's digital camera division generated approximately 15.6 billion Japanese yen ($144 million) in revenue in the fiscal year 2020.

Ltd. is another player in the mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera market. Casio is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and commercial electronics manufacturing company. However, compared to Sony and Panasonic, Casio's market presence and revenue in the mirrorless camera segment are relatively smaller. Casio is known for its compact cameras and digital watches, and while they do manufacture mirrorless cameras, their market share in the segment is not as significant as the aforementioned competitors. Therefore, specific revenue figures for their mirrorless camera division are not readily available.</p><p>In conclusion, Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. are two key players in the competitive mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera market, with strong market positions and consistent growth in recent years. Sony's Alpha series is widely recognized for its advanced technology and image quality, while Panasonic's Lumix series is popular for its video capabilities. Despite having a presence in the mirrorless camera market, Casio Computer Co. Ltd. does not have the same level of market share or revenue figures as Sony and Panasonic in this specific segment.</p></p>
