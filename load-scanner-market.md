<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Load Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Visible Light</li><li>Invisible Light</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Load Scanner market includes two types: Visible Light and Invisible Light. Visible Light scanners use beams of light that are visible to the human eye to measure and determine the load volume or weight. These scanners are commonly used in industries such as logistics and mining. On the other hand, Invisible Light scanners employ non-visible light, such as laser or infrared beams, to achieve load measurement and analysis. These scanners are advantageous in environments where visibility is limited or where greater accuracy is required.</p></p>
