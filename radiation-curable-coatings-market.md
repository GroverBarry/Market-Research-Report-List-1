<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation-Curable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultraviolet Curing</li><li>Electron Beam Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation-curable coatings refer to a type of coating that solidifies when exposed to radiation, namely ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam (EB) radiation. UV curing involves the use of UV light to initiate a photochemical reaction that causes the coating to harden. It is widely used in industries like automotive, furniture, and printing. Meanwhile, EB curing utilizes high-energy electrons to trigger crosslinking in the coating, resulting in a durable finish. This process is commonly employed in electronic manufacturing, plastics, and packaging industries. Both methods offer fast curing, minimal wastage, and environmental benefits.</p></p>
