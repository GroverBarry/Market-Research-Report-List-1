<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EVAR Stent Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abdominal Aortic Stent Grafts</li><li>Thoracic Aortic Stent Grafts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) stent grafts market includes two types: abdominal aortic stent grafts and thoracic aortic stent grafts. Abdominal aortic stent grafts are used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms, which occur in the lower part of the aorta. These grafts are inserted through a small incision in the groin and are navigated to the site of the aneurysm to provide support and prevent rupture. On the other hand, thoracic aortic stent grafts are used to treat aortic aneurysms located in the chest region. These stent grafts are similarly inserted through small incisions and are used to reinforce the weakened aortic wall, thereby preventing potential complications.</p></p>
