<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metallic brake pads market is divided into two main types: semi-metallic brake pads and low metallic NAO (non-asbestos organic) brake pads. Semi-metallic brake pads are made up of a combination of metal fibers, resins, and fillers. They offer robust performance and durability, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, low metallic NAO brake pads contain a smaller percentage of metal fibers, resulting in less noise and dust. These brake pads are ideal for everyday driving and provide a balance between effectiveness and comfort.</p></p>
