<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Temperature Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-temperature prepreg market offers two types of processing methods: autoclave processing and out-of-autoclave processing. Autoclave processing involves curing the prepreg materials in a pressurized chamber called an autoclave. This method ensures consistent pressure and temperature distribution, resulting in high-quality and uniform composite parts. On the other hand, out-of-autoclave processing refers to curing the prepreg materials without the need for an autoclave. This method utilizes alternative heating systems, such as ovens or heating blankets, to achieve the required temperature and pressure for curing the prepreg materials.</p></p>
