<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antioxidant</li><li>Heat Stabilizer</li><li>Light Stabilizer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polymer stabilizers are additives used to prevent the degradation of polymer materials. There are three main types of polymer stabilizers: antioxidants, heat stabilizers, and light stabilizers. Antioxidants inhibit the oxidation process, thus preventing polymer degradation caused by heat and oxygen exposure. Heat stabilizers, on the other hand, help withstand high temperatures without degrading the polymer. Lastly, light stabilizers protect polymers against photo-oxidation caused by UV radiation. Each type of stabilizer serves a specific purpose in keeping polymers stable and prolonging their lifespan.</p></p>
