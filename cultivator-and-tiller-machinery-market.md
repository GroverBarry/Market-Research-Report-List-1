<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cultivator and Tiller Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cultivators</li><li>Tillers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cultivators and tillers are types of machinery used in agriculture for soil preparation. Cultivators are used for shallow tilling and weed control in established fields. They typically have multiple rigid or rotating tines that stir and loosen the soil. Tillers, on the other hand, are used for deep tilling to break up hard or compacted soil. They have rotating blades or tines that dig several inches into the ground. Both cultivators and tillers help improve soil aeration, drainage, and seedbed preparation, enhancing the planting process.</p></p>
