<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Liner Hanger Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Type</li><li>Non-Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical liner hanger systems are used in oil and gas wells to suspend and seal the liner in place. The market for these systems can be classified into two types: rotating type and non-rotating type. Rotating type hangers allow rotation of the liner while running it into the well, providing more flexibility and enabling better cementing. On the other hand, non-rotating type hangers do not allow rotation and are simpler in design, making them easier to operate and more cost-effective. Both types offer distinct advantages depending on the specific requirements of the well.</p></p>
