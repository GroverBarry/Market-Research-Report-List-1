<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Closed Loop</li><li>Horizontal Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal heat pumps market consists of three main types: vertical closed loop, horizontal closed loop, and open loop. Vertical closed loop systems involve drilling boreholes vertically into the ground to circulate a heat transfer fluid and exchange heat with the earth. Horizontal closed loop systems use horizontally installed piping to transfer heat between the pump and the ground. Open loop systems extract water from a well, use it to exchange heat, and then discharge it back into a separate well or an open water source. Each type offers efficient and environmentally friendly options for heating and cooling.</p></p>
