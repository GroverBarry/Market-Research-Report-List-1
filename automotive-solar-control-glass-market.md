<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Solar Control Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbing Solar Control Glass</li><li>Reflective Solar Control Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive solar control glass refers to a type of glass specifically designed to control the amount of solar heat and light entering a vehicle's interior. The two main market types of automotive solar control glass are absorbing solar control glass and reflective solar control glass. Absorbing solar control glass works by absorbing a portion of the solar radiation, preventing it from entering the vehicle. Reflective solar control glass, on the other hand, reflects a significant portion of the solar energy, reducing heat transmission and glare. Both types of glass help in maintaining a cooler and more comfortable interior in vehicles.</p></p>
