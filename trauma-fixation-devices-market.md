<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trauma Fixation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Fixation Devices</li><li>External Fixation Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trauma fixation devices are medical devices used to stabilize and align fractured bones during the healing process. There are two main types of trauma fixation devices: internal fixation devices and external fixation devices. Internal fixation devices, such as plates, screws, and rods, are surgically implanted directly into the bone to stabilize it internally. On the other hand, external fixation devices, such as external fixators or frames, are applied externally and use pins or wires to hold the fracture in place. Both types of devices help promote proper bone healing and recovery in trauma patients.</p></p>
