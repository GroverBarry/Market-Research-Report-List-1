<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tags for Livestock Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags are used in livestock management to track and monitor animals. There are two main types: active and passive tags. Active tags have their own power source and can transmit data over longer distances. They are ideal for monitoring animals in large areas or during transportation. Passive tags, on the other hand, don't have their own power source and rely on a reader's signal to transmit data. They are typically more affordable and suitable for smaller farms or closer-range tracking.</p></p>
