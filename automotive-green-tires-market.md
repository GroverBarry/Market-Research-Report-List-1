<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Green Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive green tires market can be classified into two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed with multiple layers of rubber-coated cords, which are positioned diagonally across the tires. These tires provide better load-carrying capacity and are usually used in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and agricultural machinery. On the other hand, radial tires have steel belts running perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing enhanced grip, fuel efficiency, and a smoother ride. They are commonly used in passenger cars and light trucks due to their improved performance and durability.</p></p>
