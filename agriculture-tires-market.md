<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture tires refer to the specialized tires used on agricultural vehicles and equipment. The market for agriculture tires can be categorized into two types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires are constructed with multiple layers that radiate out from the center, providing better traction and improved fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias (crossply) agriculture tires are made with crisscross layers of cords, offering enhanced durability and resistance to damage. Both types of tires are designed to withstand the rigors of agricultural activities and meet the specific requirements of farmers.</p></p>
